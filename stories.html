        <h2>Exchanging Turquoise for Happiness</h2>
        <p>Dangphu Dingphu there lived an old man called Meme Haylay Haylay in a village in Bhutan. One day Meme Haylay was digging a meadow when he found a large round yu, a turquoise. He stopped digging and went home, carrying the stone.</p>

        <p>On the way, he met a man with a horse who asked him, “Where are you going, Meme Haylay?”</p>

        <p>The old man replied, “Meme’s fortune is burning today. As I was digging a meadow, I found this turquoise.” Before the horseman could even see the jewel, Meme Haylay proposed, “Will you exchange your horse with the stone?”</p>

        <p>The horseman was speechless, for who in the world would barter a turquoise with a horse? Meme Haylay put down his basket and showed the jewel. The horseman was only happy for the poor old man.</p>

        <p>“Will you exchange your horse with it?” Meme Haylay asked again. “Don’t joke, Meme Haylay! Your yu is priceless, whereas my horse is worthless!”</p>

        <p>“Priceless or worthless, you talk too much. If you’re for the trade, take this stone and hand over the horse’s rope to me,” Meme Haylay said, looking stern.</p>

        <p>The horseman lost no time in passing the rope to Meme Haylay and went his way with the stone. He felt like the happiest man in the world. Meme Haylay went his way, also feeling happy. In fact, he felt happier than the horseman.</p>

        <p>On the way, he met a man with an ox and exchanged the horse with the ox. He then bartered the ox with a sheep, only to exchange the sheep with a goat. He took the goat until he traded it with a rooster. In every transaction, Meme Haylay thought he was better off, while all his barter partners considered him a fool.</p>

        <p>As he went home, carrying the rooster under his left arm, he heard a song from some distance. The closer the music came, the more joyous he became. Tears of happiness welled Meme Haylay’s eyes as he listened.</p>

        <p>“I feel so happy from merely hearing the song. How happier I would feel if I knew how to sing it myself,” he thought. Suddenly he came face to face with the singer himself. The song man asked, “Where are you going?”</p>

        <p>The old man smiled. “Today, Meme’s fortune is burning. As I was digging a meadow, I found a turquoise. I exchanged it for a horse, the horse for an ox, the ox for a sheep, the sheep for a goat, and the goat for this rooster. Take this rooster and teach me how to sing.”</p>

        <p>The song man did not believe his ears. He thought it was unlikely for a poor man to find a turquoise. Only the richest, powerful, meritorious, or luckiest persons would ever find such jewels. And, he thought, supposing this poor old man was lucky, even a fool would not exchange it for a horse, the horse for an ox, the ox for a sheep, the sheep for a goat, and the goat for a rooster. One mistake would have served a lesson.

    <p>In the 15th century, Drukpa Kunley arrived to Bhutan from Tibet and helped to spread the Buddhist teaching. He has remained one of Bhutan’s most revered Buddhist masters to date. He is actually known for a more notable skill, using imagery of the phallus to subdue demons and bless the people of Bhutan</p>
    <p>His unique way of teaching Buddhism earned him the nickname of Divine Madman or The Saint of 5,000 Women. He used shock, sarcasm, sex and different methods to explain Buddha’s teachings to the masses. Above all, he was known for using his penis to awaken unenlightened beings and subduing demons that were terrorising the locals. His phallus became so famous and powerful that it was known as The Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom.</p>
    <p>Drukpa Kuenlay first visited Bhutan, a demon called Loro Duem resided at Dochula. She terrorize all the people who tried to cross Dochula and people who lives nearby lived in fear. There were two more demon living in two smaller passes. All three of made difficult for people to pass by the mountain.</p>

    <p>When Drukpa Kuenlay heard of this news, he went there to subdue all of them. after reaching there all three demon recognized Drukpa Kuenlay‘s power and they ran down the valley, two demon dissolved into body of Loro Duem. When Loro Duem reached at Lobesa, she transformed herself into a dog to hide/unrecognized by Lam Drukpa Kuenlay, but he recognized the Loro Duem who tranformed herself into dog. Drukpa Kuenlay than killed the dog and buried it under mound of a hill. he then said ‘chhi-med‘(no-dog), and built a black chorten on the place where the dog was being buried.</p>
    <p>Before Lama Drukpa Kuenlay subdued the Loro Duem, he let the demon to promise that she would help flourishing dharma teaching and made her to [promise to protect the place and serve as a local deity of that place(Chimmi Lhakhang).</p>
    <p>Lama Drukpa Kuenlay‘s cousin lam Ngawang Choegyal later built a lhakhang in honour of his cousin Drukpa Kuenlay and named it Chimmi Lhakhang.</p>
